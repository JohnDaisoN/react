there are many componnts created to rendered to react dom
components contain template and logic like html and js
root componet - only default components
function app() returns something lile html code
function start with caps
the html like code is actually jsx - uses babble to convert jsx to html
diff - in jsx we use className - converts to class in html

older react versions required import react statement in all components individually

div.content - gives class name emmet content

export defalt app - used in different files to export compoonets to used in render file index.js
functions usaually have to return smth- isually a jsx file code

basically npm and nvm - require high net
npm run build can work maybe idk
